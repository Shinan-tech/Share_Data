## Our work done:
1. We set up our repository on git hub named "Share_Data" 
2. We retrieved corona related data from the website Ourworldindata via a CSV.
3. We retrieved corona related search terms with the Google Trends API. 
3. We retrieved DAX stock ticker list and applied it into the API Alpha Vantage to retrieve all the 30 DAX stocks daily share price.
4. We combined our DAX / Corona / Trends data together and created the graph to make our conclusion.

## Our Challenges and Solutions in the project:
#### Please refer to our presentation

## Our conclusion:
#### The DAX index price daily movement is negative correlated to corona reported case / death case. There is a weak negative correlation between DAX index daily performance and the corona key word search.
